## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/) - React framework
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For Styles

### What I learned

While making this project I learned managing `redux` states. I used them to keep all movies, and toggle their importance. I also improved my skills in `styled-components`

### Continued development

It was challenging for me to make slider. I want to focus more on framer motion, for making animated websites.
